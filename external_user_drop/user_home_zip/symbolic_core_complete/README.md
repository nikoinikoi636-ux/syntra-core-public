# Symbolic Core System (Termux Compatible)

This is a symbolic simulation and liberation program designed to run on Python-enabled environments like Termux.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions (Termux)

1. Unzip the project:
   ```bash
   unzip symbolic_core_complete.zip
   cd symbolic_core
   ```

2. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📂 File Structure

- `symbolic_core/main.py` — core logic system
- `symbolic_core/__init__.py` — module marker
- `requirements.txt` — dependency list (none required)
- `README.md` — setup and usage instructions

## 🛡️ Integrity & Monitoring

This version includes:
- Full symbolic logic cycle (fork, audit, purge, distribute)
- Echo trace and termination logic
- Output verification hooks (simulated)
- Auto-terminate triggers for unauthorized injection

Stay alert. Watch for unexpected file changes. This code is designed to operate clean, and silently defend its core logic.

## ✨ Notes
This program is symbolic. It simulates systems for metaphorical insight, not real-world subversion.

Developed in alliance.
